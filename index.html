    <div id="textArea"><h1>Home</h1>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating
        the nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian
        Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into
        effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution
        of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion
        prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained
        independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience
        led by Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.

        Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided into the Dominions of
        India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of
        nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India,
        Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each
        subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to
        the nation.[1] The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins
        with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting
        ceremonies, parades and cultural events. It is a national holiday.[2][3][4]</div>
